            <p><h4 style="color:black">Study to recall not for recognition</h4>
                When you take a “fill in the blank” or essay exam, you are recalling information that you learned - or pulling it out of your memory with no assistance. When you are given “multiple choices” to choose from, you are trying to recognize the correct answer among several possibilities. Most people study differently for these types of exams, thinking they need to only familiarize themselves with information for multiple choice exams. However, professors know this, and create choices that all look “familiar.” Don’t fall for this trap! Study for RECALL every time. This means that you should be able to know the answers without any prompts or hints - right "off the top of your head". When taking the exam, to prevent the other choices from misleading you, jot down the correct answer BEFORE you look at the available choices. Then, you can MATCH your answer with the closest one provided by the multiple choices.</p>
                <p><h4 style="color:black">Protect your study time</h4>
                    Most of us are very good at observing other people’s boundaries. We make appointments to talk to our bosses, visit our professors during office hours, and do not expect office assistants to give back our exams during their lunch time. Yet, we do not give the same respect to ourselves during study time! We allow phone calls, friends, TV shows, noise, and other people’s needs to interfere with one of our most important tasks in college. Protect your study time by making firm and clear “do not disturb” boundaries around it - or by going to a private place where you can concentrate for several hours at a time. Of course, online activities can be just as distracting. Consider disconnecting from the internet or downloading an app that will temporarily shut off internet access so that you can better focus on the task at hand.

                <p><h4 style="color:black">Study in 45-min chunks</h4>
                    Research has shown that concentration, comprehension, and memory progressively decreases after 45 minutes of solid studying. If you want to study smarter, take a 15 minute break every 45 minutes, during which time you stretch your muscles by walking around and rest your eyes and mind.</p>
           
                <p><h4 style="color:black">Start with the most difficult subject first</h4>
                    As subject or topic which is most difficult will demand the most mental effort and energy from you. So always try to start with the subjects that you think are very difficult. Once you complete the most difficult task or assignment, you will get a feeling of satisfaction and it will become easy for you to complete the rest of your work.</p>
