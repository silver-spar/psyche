            <p><h4 style="color:black">Create mini-tasks:</h4>
                First, take large tasks and break them up into much smaller tasks. On the surface, this won't make much of a difference; you'll still be doing the same amount of work either way. But the mini-task structure will make it easier for you to work harder and more consistently to get that work done. Creating smaller tasks will compartmentalize your thinking, giving you perspective into the scope of the master problem and allowing you to strategize before jumping in. Then, executing those small tasks one by one will dramatically increase your motivation in continuing. The end result is that you'll be able to work more efficiently, and you'll be more motivated to keep working hard once you get going.</p>
        
                <p><h4 style="color:black">Be social:</h4>
                    We're social by nature. While some conversations might seem counterproductive, staying social in the workplace can keep your brain active, make you feel more satisfied, and help you tackle more challenging problems. Socializing with others exposes you to different perspectives and new ideas, and will help you see your work in a better light while relieving some of the stresses that can hold you back.</p>
        
                <p><h4 style="color:black">Create a consistent routine or process:</h4>
                    As humans, we are creatures of consistency. Some of us crave surprises, adventures, and new thrills, but when it comes to work, being grounded in some level of consistency is necessary in order to work consistently. Create a routine that you can predictably and comfortably follow for executing your work on a daily basis. And if you hate routines, at least create a few recurring processes for handling certain tasks in your wheelhouse. For example, if you always organize your email inbox by 9:30 and always work on a challenging problem between 9:30 and 10:30, you'll eventually master those sections of your day, and you'll end up getting more done faster.</p>    
               
                <p><h4 style="color:black">Finish challenging tasks early:</h4>
                    Once you've got that first easy task under your belt, consider moving on to something much more challenging. In fact, take a look at your task list for the day and select your most challenging problem. Work on that as soon as you've warmed up with an easy piece. If you can complete this challenging task, everything else you have to do throughout the day will seem easier by comparison, and you'll be more likely to work through the lesser problems you'll inevitably face. If you're struggling with the big task, work back to my first piece of advice and break it up into smaller sections.</p>
