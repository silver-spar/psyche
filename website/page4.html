            <p><h4 style="color:black">Progressive muscle relaxation:</h4>
                Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups (e.g., legs, stomach, back) in a sequence to help you better understand the differences between these sensations. Among many benefits, progressive muscle relaxation has been found to reduce salivary cortisol levels, anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure</p>
       
            <p><h4 style="color:black">Look after yourself:</h4>
                The stereotypical student lifestyle is not always conducive to optimal wellbeing. Getting enough sleep, eating nutritious foods, staying active, and making space for relaxation techniques and things you enjoy can go a long way.</p>
           
            <p><h4 style="color:black">Deep breathing</h4>
                Deep breathing can reduce anxiety and help people cope with stressful tasks. Diaphragmatic breathing (or “belly breathing”) involves actively breathing into your diaphragm or abdomen, as opposed to the chest.

                Deep-breathing techniques help calm the physiological systems in the body, reducing heart rate and blood pressure, increasing activation of the parasympathetic nervous system , and reducing cortisol levels.</p>           
            
            <p><h4 style="color:black">Mindfullness</h4>
                Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs have consistently shown to be an effective stress-relieving intervention. Mindfulness involves bringing your awareness to the present moment with a nonjudgmental and accepting attitude, which can help you deal with stressors more effectively when they arise.</p>
